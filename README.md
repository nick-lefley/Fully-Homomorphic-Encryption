# Fully-Homomorphic-Encryption

The .py file allows for execution of the following processes:


-Encrypt individual bits

-Decryption

-Evaluation of addition or multiplication on encrypted bits

-Recryption of encrypted bits (refresh the error term)


Combined, these processes allow for fully homomorphic encryption.

However...

In its current state, the code will not work correctly. Some of the parameters used (beginning of .py file) are too small to allow fully homomorphic encryption to return the correct values, due to computational requirements, but, currently, larger values make computation too difficult for my computer to return.

As a result, the project has been successfully concluded as a failure!
